	<h1> Kenice and Keiko's Lab3</h1>
	<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on our computer and as index.html files.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>We had a lot of trouble making our page splitscreen. We weren't able to put anything before or after our photos.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p> We successfully added the split screen and formatted the lists. Our page is up so here are our results.<p>
