    <p>Working with your partner, use your debugging knowledge to fix old assignments.</p>
		<h3 class="heading">Problems</h3>
		<p>We had to fix our JS code since the numbers divisible by 7 weren't printing onto our website output. </p>
    <h4 class="heading">Results</h4>
    <p>Input a number into the box to be our maximum value and check out our results! </p>
    <h4 class="heading">Debugging</h4>

    <p> In our output, the numbers divisible by 7 weren't printing, only the word "boom." We fixed this by using jQuery code with 'append' to isolate the parts, print the “boom” line and specify the printing of the var num. It’s not the most practical or neatly formatted solution as it doesn't match the other multiple-factors in the function, but it was the best one that worked and was accessible given our working conditions and knowledge.</p>
