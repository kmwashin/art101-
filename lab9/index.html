			<p class=par>This was the first lab where Wes didn't attach screenshots. As well, the directions were not very detailed. It required us to figure out and experiment with the elements a lot on our own. We had coded the JS correctly, but forgot to put 'defer' in the "script" section of our output div, so it wasn't showing up at first.</p>
			<h2 class="heading">Results</h2>
			<p class=par>Wow, would you look at this JS silliness!</p>

		<div id="output">
